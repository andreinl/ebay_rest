# ebay_rest
A tread-safe Python 3 pip package that conveniently wraps eBayâ€™s REST APIs.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install ebay_rest.

```bash
pip install ebay_rest
```

## Setup

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/matecsaj/ebay_rest/blob/main/tests/ebay_rest_EXAMPLE.json). 

## Usage

```python
from ebay_rest import API, DateTime, Error, Reference

try:
    api = API(use_sandbox=True)
except Error as error:
    print(f'Error {error.number} is {error.reason}  {error.detail}.\n')
else:
    try:
        for item in api.buy_browse_get_items():
            print('item id: ' + item['item_id'] + '\n')
    except Error as error:
        print(f'Error {error.number} is {error.reason} {error.detail}.\n')
    else:
        pass

print('An item is composed of the following.\n')
print(Reference.get_item_fields())

print('The official eBay date and time is ', DateTime.now(), '\n')
```

## FAQ | Frequently Asked Questions

**Question:** How are API results organized?

**Answer:**  
* Elemental information is stored in dates, integers, strings and other basic [built-in types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html).
* [Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict) contain related elements.
* [Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list) contain information organized repetitively; expect zero or more contents.
* Dicts and Lists may be nested.
* eBay classifies data as optional or mandatory. Optional elements, dicts or lists are omitted. Manditories have a [None](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html?highlight=none#None) value.
##
**Q:** How to make API calls faster?

**A:** Prioritized, do the first things first.
1. Reuse the API object.
1. Some calls have filtering options; omit unneeded data.
1. When the call returns a list, make the call in a ["for" loop](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for). 
1. Use [threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) to make calls in parallel but don't exhaust RAM.
1. Use multiprocessing. -- Multiprocessing support is a future goal. -- A safe workaround is to concurrently run copies of your program and divide the work among each.
1. Switch to a faster internet connection. 
1. Switch to computer with faster cores.
##
**Q:** How are paged calls/results handled? 

**A:** A [simple generator](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/#specification-yield) is implemented.
* To be clear, "Paging" is eBay's term for repeating a call while advancing a record offset to get all records.
* eBay documentation has the word "Page" in the return type of paging calls. 
* Do NOT supply a record "offset" parameter when making a paging call.
* The "limit" parameter is repurposed to control how many of potentially 10,000 results you want.
* If you don't supply a limit, and the result set exceeds 10,000, then an exception will throw. Supply a limit or use a more restrictive filter.
* Avoid exhausting memory by making the call within a ["for" loop](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for).
