## FAQ | Frequently Asked Questions

**Question:** How are API results organized?

**Answer:**  
* Elemental information is stored in dates, integers, strings and other basic [built-in types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html).
* [Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict) contain related elements.
* [Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list) contain information organized repetitively; expect zero or more contents.
* Dicts and Lists may be nested.
* eBay classifies data as optional or mandatory. Optional elements, dicts or lists are omitted. Manditories have a [None](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html?highlight=none#None) value.
##
**Q:** How to make API calls faster?

**A:**  
* Reuse the API object.
* Some calls have filtering options; omit unneeded data.
* When the call returns a list, make the call in a ["for" loop](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for). 
* Use [threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) to make calls in parallel but don't exhaust RAM.
